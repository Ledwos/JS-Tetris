# JS-Tetris
 
 That's right, tetris makes for a great past time in between work. It's an enjoyable way of exersicing your mind while you look away from a coding issue to allow your brain to find a solution. </br></br>
 (apparently stimulating the brain with a puzzle aids problem solving)

 Like they say, the best solutions occur away from the code. 

 ## The Stack:

 - HTML5 / CSS3
 - JS
 - Node / Express

 Nothing too fancy, the game is the focus here.
